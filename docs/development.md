# Development

## Build

```bash
go build -o vekil .
make build-app
make docker-build
make docker-build-rtk   # optional RTK image variant
make docker-rtk-e2e     # verifies bundled RTK reduces tool output through Vekil
```

`go test ./...` and ordinary Go builds do not require Sparkle. The updater code is only compiled for the packaged macOS app build via `make build-app`, which downloads Sparkle 2.9.0 into `.build/sparkle/`, passes the `sparkle` build tag, embeds `Sparkle.framework`, and ad-hoc signs the finished app bundle.

## Test

```bash
go test ./... -count=1
make compaction-lab    # fast in-process compaction regression harness
make test-app          # macOS only; builds and verifies Vekil.app
scripts/macos-app-smoke.sh  # macOS only; build + launch smoke for Vekil.app
go test ./proxy/ -run TestHandle -v
go test ./proxy/ -run TestMapStopReason/stop -v
```

`cmd/compaction-lab` starts an in-process proxy and fake `/responses` upstream, then exercises the compact-response shape, opaque compaction replay, remote compaction v2 trigger handling, and websocket `response.processed` control frames. It is intended as a quick deterministic check for compaction regressions before running live Copilot smoke tests.

## Benchmarks

```bash
go test ./proxy/ -run '^$' -bench 'BenchmarkResponsesWebSocketRequestBuild' -benchmem -count=1
go test ./proxy/ -run '^$' -bench 'BenchmarkResponsesTransport' -benchmem -count=1
go test ./proxy/ -run '^$' -bench 'BenchmarkResponsesSession' -benchmem -count=1
```

## Lint

```bash
go vet ./...
make lint
```

## CI

GitHub Actions in [`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yaml) runs lint, tests, build, vet, a Kubernetes/kind liveness smoke, and e2e validation before merge. The kind smoke builds the PR image, deploys it into a temporary kind cluster without Copilot credentials, and verifies that `/healthz` stays live with zero liveness-probe restarts while `/readyz` remains gated during device-code login.

Safe Dependabot updates are handled by [`.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yaml`](../.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yaml). It listens for Dependabot pull request lifecycle events, skips drafts, skips pull requests with requested changes, skips major updates, and only auto-approves plus enables auto-merge for semver patch/minor updates from eligible package ecosystems. Grouped Dependabot pull requests are eligible only when `dependabot/fetch-metadata` reports the highest update type as patch or minor.

The auto-merge workflow intentionally skips the `github-actions` and `docker` package ecosystems so workflow/container updates still receive manual review.

For that workflow to work, configure these repository settings and variable:

- enable auto-merge in repository settings
- allow workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` write permissions for Dependabot pull request runs
- allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests in Actions settings
- set the repository variable `DEPENDABOT_AUTO_MERGE_METHOD` to the explicit merge method to use: `merge`, `rebase`, or `squash`

The configured merge method must also be enabled for the repository; otherwise `gh pr merge --auto` cannot enable auto-merge.

The macOS tray app has its own workflow in [`.github/workflows/macos-app.yaml`](../.github/workflows/macos-app.yaml). It runs `scripts/macos-app-smoke.sh` on a macOS runner, which builds `Vekil.app`, validates the bundle contents, launches the app through Launch Services, verifies it stays up, and then quits it cleanly.

## Release

Tag pushes to [`.github/workflows/release.yaml`](../.github/workflows/release.yaml) use [`.goreleaser.yaml`](../.goreleaser.yaml) to publish the CLI binaries and checksums to GitHub Releases for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`, `windows/amd64`, and `windows/arm64`.

RTK version bumps for the optional Docker variant are automated by [`.github/workflows/update-rtk.yaml`](../.github/workflows/update-rtk.yaml). The scheduled workflow runs [`scripts/update-rtk-version.sh`](../scripts/update-rtk-version.sh), updates the pinned `RTK_VERSION` Docker build arg when `rtk-ai/rtk` publishes a new latest release, validates the rebuilt variant with `make docker-build-rtk` and `make docker-rtk-e2e`, and opens a signed PR.

The same release workflow also:

- builds `vekil-macos-arm64.zip` on a macOS runner and uploads it to the tagged release
- generates and uploads `appcast.xml` for Sparkle update checks
- updates the `vekil` cask in `sozercan/homebrew-repo`
- pushes the multi-arch container image to GHCR
- pushes the `-rtk` multi-arch container image variant to GHCR

To publish the Homebrew cask, configure the repository secret `HOMEBREW_REPO_TOKEN` with push access to `sozercan/homebrew-repo`.

To publish Sparkle updates, configure both `SPARKLE_PUBLIC_ED_KEY` and `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_ED_KEY` in the repository secrets.

## Manual Live Smoke Workflow

The repository also includes a manual `Live Copilot Smoke` workflow in [`.github/workflows/live-copilot-smoke.yaml`](../.github/workflows/live-copilot-smoke.yaml).

It builds the proxy, runs [`scripts/live-compact-smoke.sh`](../scripts/live-compact-smoke.sh), installs Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI on a GitHub-hosted runner, and then runs [`scripts/live-cli-smoke.sh`](../scripts/live-cli-smoke.sh).

The compaction smoke script starts the proxy with a non-interactive GitHub token, waits for `/readyz`, selects a currently available OpenAI/Codex model from `/v1/models`, posts to `/v1/responses/compact`, verifies that the response contains a non-empty compaction item, and replays that compaction item through `/v1/responses`.

The CLI smoke script starts the proxy with the same token pattern, waits for `/readyz`, selects currently available OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini models from `/v1/models`, and runs one file-reading headless check per CLI using isolated temp-home config directories.

This workflow is intentionally provider-specific: it exercises a live Copilot-backed deployment because zero-config startup is the simplest upstream path to run in GitHub Actions. It is useful as a real integration smoke test, but it is not the complete provider matrix for Azure OpenAI, OpenAI Codex, or generic compatible provider configs.

For a credential-free generic-provider check, [`scripts/live-zen-smoke.sh`](../scripts/live-zen-smoke.sh) starts the proxy on a non-default port with [`examples/opencode-zen-free.yaml`](../examples/opencode-zen-free.yaml), waits for `/readyz`, and sends one tiny chat completion per OpenCode Zen free model. It only needs `curl` and `jq`. Because the Zen free set rotates, the script treats a promo-ended model as a skip and passes as long as at least one free model still responds; only a proxy-side fault is a hard failure.

## Live OpenCode Zen CLI Smoke Workflow

The [`Live OpenCode Zen Smoke`](../.github/workflows/live-zen-smoke.yaml) workflow runs the **same** `scripts/live-cli-smoke.sh` harness as the Copilot smoke, but in `SMOKE_PROVIDER=zen` mode: it starts vekil with `examples/opencode-zen-free.yaml` (no credentials) and drives real coding-agent CLIs against the OpenCode Zen free tier. Because it needs no secrets, it runs on **every** pull request, **including external-contributor forks** — unlike the Copilot smoke, which self-skips on forks. It is the only live end-to-end coverage of vekil's generic `openai-compatible` provider routing (config loading, bearer auth, static model catalog, and the per-model endpoint allowlist), which zero-config Copilot startup never exercises.

The Zen harness runs the **GitHub Copilot CLI** (offline BYOK mode, `COPILOT_PROVIDER_WIRE_API=completions`), **Claude Code**, and **Gemini CLI**. It iterates the free-model preference list until one model produces exact output, using a raw chat-completions canary to tell a real proxy fault apart from an upstream outage:

- A genuine proxy fault (config rejected, `/readyz` never ready, empty `/v1/models`, an unknown-model or `does not support /…` error, or a model that the canary proves reachable yet whose CLI output is wrong) is a hard failure.
- Promo-ended / rate-limited / unreachable models are skipped; if every free model is unreachable the job neutral-skips (exit 0) so a Zen outage cannot block unrelated PRs.

OpenAI Codex CLI is intentionally excluded from Zen mode: current Codex is `/responses`-only and always sends a built-in `web_search` tool with no `name`, which the Zen free upstreams reject during the responses→chat translation. The Copilot CLI covers the same `/responses`-style client via its `completions` wire API. Codex remains covered by the Copilot smoke, where it works against the Copilot upstream.

Run it locally after `make build` (requires the three CLIs installed):

```bash
SMOKE_PROVIDER=zen PROXY_PORT=8899 PROVIDERS_CONFIG=examples/opencode-zen-free.yaml \
  scripts/live-cli-smoke.sh
```

## Live Copilot Smoke setup

To use the `Live Copilot Smoke` workflow:

1. Create a GitHub token for a user that has GitHub Copilot access.
2. Grant that token the `Copilot Requests` permission.
3. Save it as the repository secret `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
4. Run the `Live Copilot Smoke` workflow from the Actions tab.

This workflow is intentionally separate from the normal CI workflow so pull requests and forked builds remain deterministic and do not depend on live provider credentials.

You can also run the same smoke scripts locally after building `vekil`; the CLI smoke script additionally requires those three CLIs to be installed.

## Extending vekil

### Add a tool optimizer provider

- Add a new `type` case in `newToolOptimizerFromConfig` and a constructor in `proxy/`.
- Keep optimizers opt-in and disabled by default.
- Fail open: errors, timeouts, invalid JSON, or invalid replacements must preserve the original payload.
- Add config validation and tests for the new provider type.
- See [`tool-optimizers.md`](tool-optimizers.md) for the config protocols (`rtk_cli`, `exec_json`, and `noop`).

### Add or extend a provider type

- Register the provider kind in `proxy/providers.go` and its endpoint policy in `proxy/provider_endpoint_policy.go`.
- Keep upstream deployment names internal to provider config; public model IDs remain global.
- Treat `models[].endpoints` as a verified allowlist. Do not advertise routes that have not been tested for that provider/model.
- Preserve startup failure on public-model-ID collisions.
- Cross-link config examples in [`provider-routing.md`](provider-routing.md) instead of duplicating YAML here.
